# prefixer
A simple and easy-to-understand program to calculate prefix expressions. Helpful for students to learn different kinds of tree traversals, DFS, and different mathematical expression formats. A web GUI based version is available at [soumildatta.github.io/prefixer](https://soumildatta.github.io/prefixer/).

## How to run the Python script
Ensure you have Python 3 downloaded. Then you can simply run `prefixer.py` with
```
python prefixer.py
```

The program will then ask for an input file, and will process the prefix expression in your input file.
